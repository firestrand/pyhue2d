# Contributing to PyHue2D

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PyHue2D! We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions from the community.

---

## üìö Where to Start
- **Read the [CODING_GUIDELINES.md](CODING_GUIDELINES.md)** for code style, structure, and quality standards.
- See the [docs/](docs/) directory for API details and design rationale.

---

## üêû Bug Reports & Feature Requests
- **Bug reports**: Please include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant logs or screenshots.
- **Feature requests**: Describe the problem, your proposed solution, and any alternatives considered.
- Use GitHub Issues for both.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup
1. **Clone the repository** and create a branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/pyhue2d.git
   cd pyhue2d
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. **Run tests and checks**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   black src/ tests/
   flake8 src/ tests/
   mypy src/
   isort src/ tests/
   ```

**Note:** Encoder and pipeline settings are immutable after initialization. To use different settings, create a new instance.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Making Changes
- **Branch from `main`** for all work.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages (imperative mood, e.g., "Add JAB Code level-H support").
- Reference related issues in your PR description.
- Ensure all tests and checks pass before submitting a pull request.

### Conventional Commits
PyHue2D uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification so that our automated release tooling can determine the next semantic version and generate changelogs.

Prefix your commit subject with one of the following types:

* `feat:` ‚Äì new user-facing feature
* `fix:` ‚Äì bug fix
* `docs:` ‚Äì documentation changes only
* `chore:` ‚Äì CI, build system, or other internals
* `refactor:` ‚Äì code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `test:` ‚Äì adding or updating tests

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add HiQ Color-QR encoder"
```

The CI will fail if commit messages don't follow this pattern on protected branches.

---

## ‚úÖ Code Quality
- Follow [CODING_GUIDELINES.md](CODING_GUIDELINES.md) for style, structure, and documentation.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Update documentation as needed.
- **Do not mutate encoder or pipeline settings after construction; always create a new instance for different configurations.**

---

## üîç Pull Request Process
1. Open a PR against `main`.
2. The PR will be reviewed for code quality, clarity, and adherence to guidelines.
3. Respond to feedback and make requested changes.
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged.

---

## ü§ù Community & Conduct
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
- For questions, open a GitHub Discussion or Issue.
